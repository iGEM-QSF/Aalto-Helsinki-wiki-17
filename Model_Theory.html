<h3>Molecular Dynamics - an introduction</h3>
<div class="introtext">
<p>
Molecular modeling and computer simulation help us understand the properties of assemblies of molecules in terms of structure and microscopic interactions between the different components of the system. Computational chemistry methods serve as a complement to conventional experiments and often enable examination of properties that cannot be accurately or directly examined through a traditional experimental setup. Simulation also enables examination of conditions that may be unachievable in standard laboratory conditions, such as extreme temperatures or pressure. Computer simulations enable examination of phenomena in microscopic length and time scales and enable exact calculation of bulk properties based on initial assumptions about the interactions between the molecules. Additionally, computer simulation provides a bridge between theory and experiment: a theory can be tested by conducting simulations using the same model, and the validity of the model can be evaluated through comparison to experimental data. ((The two main families of computer simulation techniques are <b>molecular dynamics</b> (MD) and <b>Monte Carlo</b> (MC). Additionally, many hybrid approach methods that combine aspects of both MD and MC approaches exist.))
</p>
<p>
Molecular modeling methods ultimately aim for direct comparison with experimental measurements. As such, a good model of molecular interaction is essential. Quantum chemistry based ‘‘Ab initio’’ molecular dynamics methods aim to reduce the amount of fitting and guesswork required for accurate modeling of molecular interactions. However, such approaches are generally limited to small systems and short timescales due to the added computational demand. In classical molecular dynamics, molecules are described using stick-and-ball models: spherical atoms are connected by springs that represent bonds. As such, internal molecular forces can be described by simple mathematical models. For example, Hooke's law can be used to describe bonded interactions, while non-bonded interactions can be described by Lennard-Jones potential.
</p>
<p>
Molecular dynamics is based on numerical, step-by-step, evaluation of Newton’s equations of motion. Due to the many-body nature of the problem, Newton’s equations of motion are discretized and solved numerically. MD  trajectories, that describe the time evolution of the system, consist of both position and velocity vectors of the particles in the system. The position and velocity vectors are reevaluated according to a finite time interval by using numerical integrators. The position vectors define the geometric configuration of the system while the velocity vectors define the kinetic energy and temperature of the system.

<h3>More on Integrators</h3>
<div class="basictext">
<p>
Numerical integration of Newton’s equations of motion aims to find an expression that defines the positions \(\textbf{r}_i(t+\Delta t)\) based on already known positions \(\textbf{r}_i(t)\) at time \(t\). For this integration, the Verlet formula, derived from taylor expansions for the positions \(\textbf{r}_i(t)\), is often used due to its simplicity and stability. All of the most commonly used integrators are time reversible, meaning that the direction of the simulation time is arbitrary. In the event that the signs of the velocities of all atoms were swapped, the simulation would run exactly in the reverse direction. Velocities can be subsequently calculated from the positions or produced explicitly using leapfrog of velocity Verlet schemes. In theory, the exact MD trajectory is defined using an infinitesimally small time step \(\Delta t\). In practice, however, larger values \(\Delta t\) are used to enable examination of longer timescales. The value of \(\Delta t\) is determined by the speed of the motions of the system as well as the examined properties. Due to the commonly high vibrational frequencies of intramolecular bonds, it is common to treat bonds as having a fixed length by introducing constraints.

<h3>On Evaluating Dynamic Properties</h3>
<div class="basictext">
<p>
In statistical mechanics, physical properties of a system can be represented by averaging over microscopic states of the examined system, that are distributed according to the statistical ensemble. Examples of statistical mechanics ensembles include the microcanonical ensemble, in which only the states corresponding to a specific energy have a chance of occurring, and the canonical ensemble, where temperature remains constant but energy can be exchanged with the surroundings. In the case of a canonical ensemble, the probability of states is given by the Boltzmann function. Dependence upon Newtonian dynamics implies the conservation of energy and MD trajectories provide configurations distributed according to the microcanonical ensemble. In practice, however, energy is not entirely conserved, even in the case of a microcanonical ensemble, due to accumulation of errors from the numerical integration. MD can be generalized to sample other statistical ensembles, such as the canonical ensemble through introduction of coupling to a heat bath. MD trajectories may be analyzed to provide time averaged properties of the system. Theoretically, assuming an infinite simulations time, these averages converge to the true value of the examined thermodynamic property. However, in practice, the quality of sampling is limited by computation time and may be especially poor for processes that exceed the timescale of typical MD simulations.

<h3>On Force Fields</h3>
<p>
Choosing an appropriate energy functions for describing the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in a system is paramount for a successful MD simulation. Nonbonded interactions tend to be described by a simple, pairwise additive function, accounting only for nuclear coordinates as justified by the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. For bonded interactions, simple two-body, three-body, and four-body terms are used to describe the formation of bonds, angles and dihedrals. The many parameters of energy functions are generally obtained from experimental studies or quantum mechanical calculations of molecules and their fragments.
</p>
<p>
The energy functions and their associated parameters together define a forcefield. The choice of force field for an MD simulation depends upon the system as well as the desired level of abstraction. All-atom force fields provide parameters for every single atom in the system. United-atom force fields, such as the GROMOS force field family, often treat a carbon and its associated hydrogens as one interaction center. Coarse-grained force fields offer a more abstract representation alternative for long timescale simulation of macromolecules, such as proteins and lipids, and large systems by providing a rougher description the particles in the systems. ((An example of a coarse-grained force field is the <b>MARTINI</b> force field. The MARTINI forcefield generally uses a four-to-one mapping, meaning that four heavy atoms and their associated hydrogens are mapped as one interaction center.))

<h3>On Enforcement of Periodic Boundary Conditions</h3>
<div class="basictext">
<p>
In molecular dynamics periodic boundary conditions are often introduced to account for the small sample size of the simulation. This set of boundary conditions is introduced for approximating a large system based on the simulated unit cell. The simulation box is surrounded with replicas of itself in each direction. During the simulation, if a particle leaves the boundaries of the simulation box, attention is switched to the incoming image.
</p>
<p>
Periodic boundary conditions can be useful for examining behavior of macroscale systems. However, it must be noted that, in the case of long-range potentials such as electrostatic forces, periodic boundary conditions may introduce correlational artifacts. In the case systems containing coulombic interactions, the net electrostatic charge of the system must be zero to avoid accumulation of infinite charge when periodic boundary conditions are applied. Adjusting the charge of the system to zero may require addition of counterions. This is prevalent in the simulation of macromolecules, such as proteins, with a net charge or complexed charged groups or ions. For sound periodicity, it is also required that possible cutoffs for long range interactions are at least half the length of the side of a simulation cubicle so as to maintain the minimum-image convention. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the size of the simulation box is large enough to avoid artifacts stemming from periodicity. Generally, a molecule must be unable to interact with its own mirror image.

<h3>GROMOS Force Field Family</h3>
<div class="basictext">
<p>
In most of the MD simulations incorporated into our project, we use the <b>GROMOS53A6</b> force field parameter set. GROMOS53A6 is considered a united-tom force field, which maps a carbon and its associated hydrogens as one interaction center. The parametrization of the forcefield is based on accurate reproduction of free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation of a wide range of compounds. The relative free enthalpy of solvation between apolar and polar environments is an important property in many biological phenomena, including protein folding and membrane formation. GROMOS53A6 is the parameter set of choice for simulating biomolecules in explicit solvent. For setting up, running, and analyzing our simulations, we utilize the <b>GROMACS v.4.6.7</b> simulation package.
